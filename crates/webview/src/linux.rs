//! The Linux backend: a GTK window holding a WebKitGTK view over an ephemeral web context.
//!
//! Nothing links webkit2gtk. GPUI talks to X11 or Wayland itself and the app has no GTK anywhere
//! else, so the library is opened at runtime with `dlopen` and a system without it simply answers
//! `supported() == false` — which is also what keeps the Flatpak runtime, which ships no
//! webkitgtk, building and running unchanged. `dlsym` walks a handle's dependencies, so the one
//! webkit2gtk handle resolves gtk, glib, gobject and soup too and no other soname is named here.
//!
//! GTK may be initialised once per process and only ever touched from the thread that did it, so
//! one resident thread owns every sign-in window. It parks on a condvar while no window is up,
//! runs `gtk_main` while one is, and services the poll side from a timer inside that loop. The two
//! threads share nothing but `Session`.
